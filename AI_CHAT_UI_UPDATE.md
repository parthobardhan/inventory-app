# AI Chat UI Update - ChatGPT Style Interface

## Overview
Updated the AI Inventory Assistant interface to display as a compact ChatGPT-style chatbox on the home page with profit metrics on the side. The layout is optimized to fit the entire interface on screen without scrolling.

## Changes Made

### 1. HTML Structure (`public/index.html`)
- **Removed**: 
  - Popup chat widget that appeared as a fixed position overlay
  - "AI Inventory Assistant" header text for cleaner look
- **Added**: Hero-based chat interface integrated into the main page content
- **Layout**: 
  - Compact chat container on the left (main focus)
  - Two profit metric tiles on the right (Current Month & Previous Month)
  - Action buttons below the main content
  - Optimized sizing to prevent scrolling on standard screens

### 2. JavaScript (`public/js/ai-agent.js`)
- Updated element references from popup IDs to hero-based IDs:
  - `chatInput` → `heroChatInput`
  - `chatMessages` → `heroChatMessages`
  - `chatWidget` → `heroChatWidget`
  - `sendChatBtn` → `heroSendChatBtn`
  - All other elements updated accordingly
- Removed `openChat()` and `closeChat()` methods (no longer needed)
- Chat is now always visible on the home page

### 3. CSS Styling

#### `public/css/ai-chat.css`
- Made styles reusable for both hero and popup contexts
- Shared classes for:
  - `.hero-chat-body` and `.ai-chat-body`
  - `.hero-chat-input` and `.ai-chat-input`
  - `.hero-chat-suggestions` and `.ai-chat-suggestions`
- Updated drop zone styling to match hero container's border radius
- Responsive design maintained for all screen sizes

#### `public/css/components/hero.css`
- Optimized chat container height to 420px (desktop) for no-scroll experience
- Reduced padding throughout for more compact design
- Added `position: relative` for proper drop zone positioning
- Adjusted spacing between elements for better fit
- Updated responsive breakpoints:
  - Desktop (>1200px): 420px height
  - Large tablet (992px-1200px): 400px height
  - Tablet (768px-992px): 380px height
  - Small mobile (480px-768px): 340px height
  - Extra small (<480px): 300px height
- Smaller font sizes and padding for profit tiles
- Reduced gaps and margins throughout

### 4. Features Preserved
All existing functionality remains intact:
- ✅ Voice input with silence detection
- ✅ Image upload and analysis
- ✅ Drag and drop for images
- ✅ Auto-resizing text input
- ✅ Suggestion chips
- ✅ Message history
- ✅ Conversation context
- ✅ All AI agent capabilities

## UI Improvements

### Before
