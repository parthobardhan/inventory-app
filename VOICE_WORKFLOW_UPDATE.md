# Voice Workflow Update - Two-Step Process

## Overview

The voice input feature has been updated to use a **two-step process** that gives users more control over their voice commands.

## What Changed

### Old Workflow (Single-Step)
```
User speaks â†’ Transcribe â†’ Process with AI â†’ Show result
```
- Voice was immediately transcribed and sent to AI
- No chance to review or edit the transcription
- Errors in transcription were sent directly to AI

### New Workflow (Two-Step) âœ…
```
User speaks â†’ Transcribe â†’ Show in text box â†’ User reviews/edits â†’ User clicks Send â†’ Process with AI â†’ Show result
```
- Voice is transcribed and shown in an editable text box
- User can review the transcription
- User can edit any errors before sending
- User clicks "Send" button to process with AI
- Press Enter key as shortcut to send

## Benefits

1. **Better Accuracy**: Users can fix transcription errors before processing
2. **User Control**: Users decide when to send the message
3. **Transparency**: Users see exactly what will be sent to the AI
4. **Edit Capability**: Users can modify or enhance the transcribed text
5. **Confidence Feedback**: Users see transcription confidence scores

## Files Modified

### 1. `/public/voice-test.html`
- Added message input text box with Send button
- Split audio processing into two steps:
  - Step 1: Transcribe via `/api/voice/transcribe`
  - Step 2: Send via `/api/agent/chat` (when user clicks Send)
- Added keyboard support (Enter to send, Ctrl+Enter for new line)
- Updated UI to show transcription metadata and confidence
- Updated instructions to reflect new workflow

### 2. `/public/js/ai-agent.js`
- Modified `processAudio()` function to only transcribe
- Transcribed text now populates the chat input field
- Users see confidence score in status message
- Removed automatic AI processing
- Send button processes text when user is ready

### 3. `/README_VOICE.md`
- Updated documentation to explain two-step workflow
- Added new architecture diagram
- Updated integration examples
- Clarified recommended API usage

## API Usage

### Recommended Pattern

```javascript
// Step 1: Transcribe audio
const transcribeResponse = await fetch('/api/voice/transcribe', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ audioData: base64Audio })
});

const { transcript, confidence } = await transcribeResponse.json();

// Show in text box for user review
document.getElementById('input').value = transcript;

// Step 2: User clicks Send, then process with AI
const aiResponse = await fetch('/api/agent/chat', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ message: transcript })
});
```

### Legacy Pattern (Still Available)

The old single-step `/api/voice/chat` endpoint is still available for backward compatibility:

```javascript
const response = await fetch('/api/voice/chat', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({ audioData: base64Audio })
});
// Returns both transcript and AI response immediately
```

## User Experience

### Voice Test Page (`/voice-test.html`)

1. User clicks "Start Recording" ðŸŽ¤
2. User speaks their command
3. Recording auto-stops after 1.5s of silence (or manual stop)
4. Transcription appears in text box with:
   - The transcribed text (editable)
   - Confidence score (e.g., "95.3% confidence")
   - Duration of audio
   - Green checkmark: "Ready to send"
5. User reviews and optionally edits the text
6. User clicks "Send" button (or presses Enter)
7. AI processes the message and shows response

### Main Chat Interface

1. User clicks microphone icon ðŸŽ¤ in chat
2. User speaks their message
3. Recording auto-stops on silence
4. Transcription appears in chat input field
5. Status shows: "âœ… Transcribed (95.3% confidence). Review and click Send."
6. User reviews/edits the text
7. User clicks Send button (or presses Enter)
8. AI processes and responds in chat

## Backward Compatibility

- The `/api/voice/chat` endpoint remains available
- Existing integrations continue to work
- New integrations should use the two-step approach

## Testing

1. Start the server: `npm run dev`
2. Open: `http://localhost:3000/voice-test.html`
3. Try voice commands:
   - "Add 30 cushion covers for $45 SKU CC-003"
   - "Show me all bed covers"
   - "What are the top selling products?"
4. Verify transcription appears in text box
5. Try editing the text before sending
6. Verify AI processes the edited text correctly

## Configuration

No additional configuration needed. Just ensure your API keys are set:

```env
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your_key_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

## Summary

This update transforms voice input from a "fire and forget" feature into a **transparent, user-controlled process** that gives users confidence in what they're sending to the AI. The transcription step becomes visible and editable, leading to better accuracy and user satisfaction.
