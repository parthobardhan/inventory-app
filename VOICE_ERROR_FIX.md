# Voice Error Fix: "No speech detected"

## Problem Summary

After removing the `/api/voice` route from the server, the voice input feature was showing "❌ No speech detected" error.

## Root Cause

The application has **two voice input systems**:

1. **Legacy System** (Simple recording)
   - Records audio → Sends to `/api/voice/transcribe` → Transcribes to text → User reviews and sends manually
   - ❌ This endpoint no longer exists after removing voice routes

2. **LiveKit System** (Real-time voice agent)
   - Connects to LiveKit room → Real-time conversation with AI agent
   - ✅ This is the intended system to use

The frontend code would check if LiveKit is available. If not, it would fall back to the legacy system, which tried to call the missing `/api/voice/transcribe` endpoint, resulting in the "No speech detected" error.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Removed Voice Route Dependencies
**File:** `server.js`
- Removed `const voiceRoutes = require('./routes/voice');` (line 21)
- Removed `app.use('/api/voice', voiceRoutes);` (line 217)

### 2. Fixed LiveKit Client Library Loading
**Files:** `public/index.html`, `package.json`, `public/vendor/`
- Installed `livekit-client@2.1.0` locally via npm
- Copied library to `public/vendor/livekit-client.umd.js` for local serving
- Changed from CDN to local file for reliability (no more 404 errors)
- Added detection script to check what the library exports
- Creates an alias if needed to ensure compatibility

### 3. Enhanced LiveKit Availability Check
**File:** `public/js/livekit-voice.js`
- Updated `isAvailable()` to check multiple possible export names
- Added helper method `getLiveKitClient()` for consistent access
- Added warning logging when LiveKit isn't detected

### 4. Fixed Undefined Variable Bugs
**File:** `public/js/livekit-voice.js`
- Fixed references to undefined `LK` variable in event handlers
- Ensured consistent use of `LivekitClient` throughout

## How It Works Now

When you click the microphone button:

```
1. Check if LiveKit is available
2. If YES → Start LiveKit voice session (real-time conversation)
3. If NO → Show warning in console, fall back gracefully
```

## Testing the Fix

1. **Start the Server**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/partho.bardhan/Documents/projects/inventory-app
   node server.js
   ```

2. **Open Browser Console**
   - Open http://localhost:3000
   - Open Developer Tools (F12)
   - Check console for: `LiveKit library check:` message

3. **Test Voice Input**
   - Click the microphone button in the AI chat widget
   - You should see connection messages in console
   - The button should show "connected" state
   - Speak and the agent should respond in real-time

## Expected Console Output

✅ **Successful LiveKit Load:**
```
LiveKit library check: {LivekitClient: true, LiveKit: false, ...}
✅ LiveKit Voice initialized
```

❌ **If LiveKit Fails to Load:**
```
LiveKit library check: {LivekitClient: false, LiveKit: false, ...}
⚠️ LiveKit client library not detected. Please ensure livekit-client is loaded.
⚠️ LiveKit Voice not available, will use legacy voice recording
```

## Troubleshooting

### If you still see "No speech detected":

1. **Check Console** - Look for LiveKit detection messages
2. **Check Network Tab** - Ensure `livekit-client.umd.min.js` loads successfully
3. **Verify Environment Variables** - Ensure these are set in `dev.env`:
   ```env
   LIVEKIT_URL=wss://your-instance.livekit.cloud
   LIVEKIT_API_KEY=your_api_key
   LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
   ```

4. **Check Microphone Permissions** - Browser must have mic access
5. **Use HTTPS/Localhost** - Microphone access requires secure context

### If LiveKit isn't loading:

1. **Check local file exists:** Verify `/public/vendor/livekit-client.umd.js` exists
2. **Check browser console:** Look for 404 errors on `/vendor/livekit-client.umd.js`
3. **Reinstall if needed:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/partho.bardhan/Documents/projects/inventory-app
   npm install livekit-client@2.1.0
   cp node_modules/livekit-client/dist/livekit-client.umd.js public/vendor/
   ```

## Architecture

```
Voice Button Click
    ↓
Check if LiveKit Available
    ↓
    ├─ YES → Start LiveKit Session
    │          ↓
    │      Generate Token (/api/livekit/token)
    │          ↓
    │      Connect to LiveKit Room
    │          ↓
    │      Enable Microphone
    │          ↓
    │      Real-time Voice Conversation with Agent
    │
    └─ NO → Show Warning
             (Legacy system disabled)
```

## Configuration

**Backend:** LiveKit is configured in `/routes/livekit.js`
- Generates access tokens for clients
- Manages room creation and deletion

**Frontend:** LiveKit voice manager in `/public/js/livekit-voice.js`
- Handles real-time voice connections
- Manages audio tracks
- Processes agent responses

**Agent:** Python voice agent in `/services/agent.py`
- Listens for voice input
- Processes requests using OpenAI
- Executes inventory tools
- Responds with synthesized speech

## Next Steps

1. Test the voice feature thoroughly
2. Ensure Python agent (`agent.py`) is running if using LiveKit agents
3. Monitor console logs for any issues
4. Consider removing the legacy recording code entirely if LiveKit works well
